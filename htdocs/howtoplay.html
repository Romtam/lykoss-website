            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Werewolf is an IRC game based on the Mafia party game. Roles are randomly distributed to the players at the beginning of the game. There are two teams: The werewolves and the villagers, both of whom attempt to kill each other. The game ends when the villagers have found all wolves or when the werewolves equal or outnumber the number of alive villagers.</p>
            <p>Whereas the werewolves are aware of their fellows, the villagers are unaware of others' roles and must figure out these either by guessing or through the use of special roles. The werewolves can communicate through the bot (commonly referred to as the "wolfchat").</p>
            <p>The game follows a cycle of two phases: night and day. The game starts with a night, which lasts up to 2 minutes or when all night specials have acted. During the night, the werewolves pick a victim, and the other special roles use their abilities. When nighttime ends, the village is informed of the victim and other deaths. Day lasts up to 12 minutes, or when a majority votes to lynch one player. Day is also when the detective role and the gunner can use their special abilities.</p>
            <p>When a majority has been reached, the target is killed and the village is informed of their actual role. The game enters another night phase if there are werewolves remaining. The game ends if all wolves have been killed or if the wolves outnumber the remaining villagers.</p>
