            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Werewolf is an IRC game based on the Mafia party game. Roles are randomly distributed to the players at the beginning of the game. There are two teams: The werewolves and the villagers, both of whom attempt to kill each other. The game ends when the villagers have found all wolves or when the werewolves equal or outnumber the number of alive villagers.</p>
            <p>Whereas the werewolves are aware of their fellows, the villagers are unaware of others' roles and must figure out these either by guessing or through the use of special roles. The werewolves can communicate through the bot (commonly referred to as the "wolfchat").</p>
