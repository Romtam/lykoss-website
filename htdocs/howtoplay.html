            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Werewolf is an IRC game based on the Mafia party game. Roles are randomly distributed to the players at the beginning of the game. There are two teams: The werewolves and the villagers, both of whom attempt to kill each other. The game ends when the villagers have found all wolves or when the werewolves equal or outnumber the number of alive villagers.</p>
            <p>Whereas the werewolves are aware of their fellows, the villagers are unaware of others' roles and must figure out these either by guessing or through the use of special roles. The werewolves can communicate through the bot (commonly referred to as the "wolfchat").</p>
            <p>The game follows a cycle of two phases: night and day. The game starts with a night, which lasts up to 2 minutes or when all night specials have acted. During the night, the werewolves pick a victim, and the other special roles use their abilities. When nighttime ends, the village is informed of the victim and other deaths. Day lasts up to 12 minutes, or when a majority votes to lynch one player. Day is also when the detective role and the gunner can use their special abilities.</p>
            <p>When a majority has been reached, the target is killed and the village is informed of their actual role. The game enters another night phase if there are werewolves remaining. The game ends if all wolves have been killed or if the wolves outnumber the remaining villagers.</p>
            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>After the game is started, the Werewolf bot (lykos) will choose a random set of players and assign them roles. Not everyone has a role, so if you don't get a PM, sit back and wait for day.</p>
            <h3>Werewolf roles</h3>
            <p>There are three different werewolf roles that are assigned based on the player count. They are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wolf &mdash; The wolf forms the backbone of the wolfteam. One game can have up to four wolves; they are assigned at the following player counts:
                <ul>
                    <li>4 players &mdash; first wolf</li>
                    <li>10 players &mdash; second wolf</li>
                    <li>15 players &mdash; third wolf</li>
                    <li>20 players &mdash; fourth wolf</li>
                </ul>
                At night, the wolves can communicate with each other through the wolfchat and decide who they are going to target. The night ends when all wolves agree on one target; otherwise, the target with most votes is targeted.</li>
                <li>Traitor &mdash; The traitor is a werewolf role that appears in games with eight players or more. The traitor has an important role in that they appear to be a normal villager until all other werewolves have died. This ensures "half-safes" aren't completely safe as they could be a traitor. Whereas the seer (see below) sees the traitor as a villager, the traitor can still be cursed (see below) and therefore be seen as wolf. Also, the detective (see below) can ID the true role of a traitor.</li>
                <li>Werecrow &mdash; The werecrow is basically a normal wolf, but they can also choose to "observe" during nighttime. This means they will turn into a crow and observe a chosen target. When the night ends, the werecrow is informed of whether the target was sleeping, or if they were out from bed, which means they have a nightrole. However, note that werecrow can observe OR kill, which means that they should usually kill instead of observe if all wolves are dead. A werecrow is seen as a wolf to the seer.</li>
            </ul>
